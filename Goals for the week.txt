For this week, I plan to do the following:

1. Review the topics that I have learned in trainning (Selenium, Angular, etc.) by looking up video tutorials.
2. Wait upon interview status with the Bank of America
3. Practice coding through HackerRank challenges.
4. Study for any future interviews if any more come this week.

No blockers at the moment.
